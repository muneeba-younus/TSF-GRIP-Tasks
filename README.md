# Prediction_using_Decision_Tree_Algorithm - Task 6

A decision tree is a machine learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their subsequent consequences to arrive at a particular decision. 
It is a Supervised Machine Learning model, where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter, and finally, a decision is made.

Usually, a decision tree is drawn upside down, with the root node at the top and the leaf nodes at the bottom. A decision tree usually contains 3 types of nodes.

Root node: The very top node that represents the entire population or sample.
Decision nodes: Sub-nodes that split from the root node.
Leaf nodes: Nodes with no children, also known as terminal nodes.
